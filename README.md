# Town_Out_West

     This is a personal project being developed within in Unity. It is a single player first-person rogue-like town builder. The Town out West takes place in a fantasy world where the new world was discovered in the medieval age. As the new explorers try to explore further into the west they start to encounter monsters they have never even imagined. The next step in development is to integrate my creature generation scripts from my capstone project.

* Procedural generated level
  * Creates the appearance of a never ending forest loop.
  * Used Noise functions to change the height map of the terrain.
  * Randomly places "rooms" through out and creates winding paths between the different rooms.
  * Places foliage through out terrain, paths and "rooms".

* Equipment
  * Allows players to equip new armor and weapons' that will asset them in game play.
  * Switching animation between sword bow and resource equipment.

* Inventory System
  * An inventory system to keep differing sets of equipment to change on the fly
  * monster random drop system to sell drops to the town.
